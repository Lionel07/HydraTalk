            <h1>Privacy</h1>
            <p>
                This is by no means meant to be legally binding.
                This a personal letter to people who care about their privacy.
            </p>
            <p>Hydra Talk is not interested in your personal info. It saves what it needs to function locally on your computer. As of now, other then getting the actual app from the web, it does NOT communicate with the Hydra Talk servers</p>
            <p>There is no database. There are no ads. The only thing in use is Google Analytics. Hydra Talk will not track you. It will not send any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>The Application is Open Source. You can check the code yourself. </p>
            <p>
                While I definately could make a profit off of this, I am not interested.
                The farthest I would go is donations. I am a high school student, and I'd like some money for college and education.
                Besides that, I'm only interested in making a quality, usable, app that will make people's lives easier.
                And well, this will honestly look good on a resume.
                I believe by being honest and upfront, that I will be trustworty to you, the privacy concious reader.
            </p>

                From,
